# **Professional and academic data science portfolio**

This website is a portfolio of the skills I have developed in data science, data visualization, and econometrics whilst pursuing my Master's of Public Administration (MPA) in energy policy and data analytics at Columbia University.

**Shiny Apps**: Having completed the course *Econometrics with R* at Columbia, I was hired by a start-up to build an interactive dashboard for their [Distributed Solar Market Reports](dgplusdesign.com/research#solar). The [first dashboard](zacharyg.shinyapps.io/ny_distributed_solar) is a simplified sample of the subscription-based dashboard. To further develop my skills in reactive coding and data manipulation/presentation, I have built more Shiny dashboards in my free time concerning topics about which I feel passionate, for example, this [Interactive Dashboard of Global Emissions Data](zacharyg.shinyapps.io/global_emissions)

**Econometrics Paper** is my final project for my Columbia course *Applied Econometrics*. It employs regression analysis to examine the unexpected causal links between lockdowns, mobility, and improved air quality in spring 2020 in the United States.

## **About me:**

<justify>
I have four years of professional experience in energy and decarbonization policy. While the bulk of my work has surrounded market and policy frameworks to facilitate deployment of low-carbon and energy-efficient heating and cooling technologies, I have also contributed extensively to projects concerning the role of policy in abating urban transport emissions, strategies to reduce carbon leakage in the EU ETS, and the potential for distributed renewables to facilitate energy access in off-grid areas. My research pertaining to energy and development has been published by the [International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/publications/2020/Nov/Renewable-Energy-Policies-in-a-Time-of-Transition-Heating-and-Cooling), [World Wildlife Fund](https://www.vivideconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WWF_Report_VIVID_Climate_2019_web.pdf), and [Inter-American Development Bank](http://www.itc.gov.bz/uploads/1/2/7/5/12751065/regional_economic_development_master_plan_for_corozal____action_plan_final.pdf), and will also contribute significantly NYSERDA's forthcoming Building Electrification Roadmap, a component of the $230m [NYS Clean Heat Market Development Plan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/12/f81/bto-2020-peer-preview-nyserda-electrification.pdf).
